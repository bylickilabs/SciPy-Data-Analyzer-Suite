## 📂 Application Contents

The ZIP file contains:

```
scipy_application.zip
│
├── data_analyzer_suite.py    # Python script of the application
└── sample_data.csv           # Sample CSV data
```

---

## 🚩 Requirements

Please ensure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib
```

---

## 🚦 Quick Start

1. Download and unzip the ZIP file:

```bash
unzip scipy_application.zip
cd scipy_application
```

2. Start the application:

```bash
python data_analyzer_suite.py
```

## 🛠️ Customizing CSV Data

The sample CSV file (`sample_data.csv`) has the following structure:

```yarn
time,value
0,0.5
1,0.7
2,
3,1.5
4,2.1
5,3.8
6,
7,5.1
8,6.2
```

Edit this file or replace it with your own data. Note that the `value` column contains numeric values and may allow missing values.
